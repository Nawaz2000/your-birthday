		horse.put("Horse", "The horse was the most frequent transport means in ancient society and it is considered as No. 1 of the most important 6 animals in China.

In some west areas of China, monkey is also believed to be able to protect little babies from evil spirits.");
		rooster.put("Rooster", "Back in ancient times when there was no alarm clock, rooster played an important role of waking people up. Thus the first symbolic meaning of Chinese zodiac Rooster sign is punctuality. Besides, it was believed by ancient people that its crow and blood could dispel evil spirits, and that’s why rooster is also the embodiment of good luck.");
